As of October 2023, here's an overview of how Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Coca-Cola has grown:

1. **Initial Investment**: Berkshire Hathaway invested approximately $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola by purchasing around 400 million shares at an average price of about $3.25 per share.

2. **Value Appreciation**: Over the years, the value of Coca-Cola shares has increased significantly. The stock has appreciated many times over since Buffett first invested. As of late 2023, Coca-Cola's stock price has risen to over $60 per share, leading to a substantial increase in the overall value of Berkshire’s holdings.

3. **Dividends**: In addition to capital appreciation, Coca-Cola has consistently paid dividends. Berkshire Hathaway has received billions in dividends from its Coca-Cola investment, which have been reinvested or used to support other investments. The dividend yield has provided a steady income stream, contributing to the overall return on investment.

4. **Long-Term Strategy**: Buffett’s investment philosophy emphasizes long-term value and holding quality companies. Coca-Cola has remained a core holding in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio for decades, reflecting Buffett's belief in its brand and business model.

5. **Market Influence**: Coca-Cola has maintained a strong market presence globally, benefiting from its extensive distribution network and brand recognition. This has helped sustain its profitability and, in turn, the value of Berkshire's investment.

Overall, Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Coca-Cola serves as a prime example of Buffett's investment strategy and has yielded significant returns both through appreciation and dividends, solidifying its status as one of the company's most successful ventures.

Content: ŠBerkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasingour ownership to 9.2% versus 8.7% at yearend 2012) and IBM (6.3% versus 6.0%). Meanwhile, stockrepurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1% and our interest in American Express from 13.7% to 14.2%. And, if youthink tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, eachincrease of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire’s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.

Content: American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially
completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from thisinvestment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely
to increase.
These dividend gains, though pleasing, are farfrom spectacular. But they bring with them
important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion whileAmex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s networth, akin to its weighting long ago.
Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one
that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be ahigh-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so ofannual income.

Content: During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own 
Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings  in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase. 
Both AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16% 
in the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the 
year. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell 
you: “No way.” 
Though Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect 
ownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every  asset that Berkshire
